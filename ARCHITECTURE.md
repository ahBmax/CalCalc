## 📊 **Advanced TDEE Calculation Engine**

### **Multiple BMR Formulas (Accuracy Hierarchy):**

1. **Katch-McArdle** (Most Accurate with Body Fat %)
   - Formula: BMR = 370 + (21.6 × Lean Body Mass)
   - Requires: Body fat percentage
   - Accuracy: ±3-5% when body fat is accurate

2. **Cunningham** (Lean Mass Based)
   - Formula: BMR = 500 + (22 × Lean Body Mass)
   - Alternative to Katch-McArdle
   - Good for athletes with high muscle mass

3. **Mifflin-St Jeor** (Standard)
   - Formula: BMR = (10 × weight) + (6.25 × height) - (5 × age) + sex_factor
   - Most widely validated
   - Fallback when body fat unknown

4. **Harris-Benedict** (Legacy)
   - Older formula, less accurate
   - Included for comparison

### **Advanced Activity Factor Calculation:**

**Base Activity Multipliers:**
- Sedentary: 1.2
- Light: 1.375

**AI-Enhanced Adjustments:**
- **NEAT Assessment**: Job type, daily movement patterns
- **Training Type Analysis**: Powerlifting vs CrossFit vs running
- **Lifestyle Factors**: Commute, household activities, hobbies
- **Individual Factors**: Age, metabolism, stress levels

### **Metabolic Factors:**

1. **Thermic Effect of Food (TEF)**
   - Protein: 20-30% of calories
   - Carbs: 5-10% of calories
   - Fat: 0-3% of calories
   - Meal frequency impact

2. **Adaptive Thermogenesis**
   - Metabolic adaptation to calorie restriction
   - Individual variation factors
   - Stress and sleep impact

3. **Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (EAT)**
   - Training type and intensity
   - Duration and frequency
   - Post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC)

   - Extract activity patterns
   - Identify training types
   - Assess lifestyle factors

2. **Contextual Understanding**
   - "I sit at a desk but fidget a lot" → Higher NEAT
   - "I do CrossFit 4x/week" → High-intensity training adjustments
   - "I'm a nurse on my feet all day" → High occupational activity

3. **Pattern Recognition**
   - Identify common adherence risks
   - Predict metabolic responses
   - Suggest optimal strategies
